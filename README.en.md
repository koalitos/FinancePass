## 🎯 About the Project

**FinancePass** is a complete personal financial management system with integrated password manager, created to give people back some of the **privacy that big tech companies took away**.

### Why does this project exist?

We're tired of:
- 🚫 Paying monthly subscriptions to manage our own money
- 🚫 Having our financial data stored on third-party servers
- 🚫 Depending on internet connection to access our information
- 🚫 Not having control over our own data

**FinancePass** is the answer: 100% free, open source, and your data stays only on your computer.

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

### Your data, your control

### What do big tech companies do with your data?

**With FinancePass, this doesn't happen. Your data is YOURS.**
